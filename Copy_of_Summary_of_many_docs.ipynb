When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers. Out-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with Northwind Health. As a result, they are not required to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the cost. Additionally, out-of-network providers may not offer additional services or discounts that are available to in-network providers. When choosing a provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is in-network. While it is possible to receive care from out-of-network providers, it is important to understand that you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is recommended that you choose an in-network provider whenever possible. There are some exceptions when it comes to receiving care from out-of-network providers. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, you may receive care from an outof-network provider. In these cases, the cost of care may be more expensive and you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. In addition to understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, it is important to understand the cost sharing associated with each. Northwind Standard does not cover the full cost of care for out-of-network providers, so you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. When choosing a provider, it is important to take into account the cost sharing associated with each provider. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. Finally, it is important to be aware of any additional fees that may be associated with receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Some providers may charge additional fees for services that are not covered by Northwind Standard. It is important to ask about any additional fees before receiving care from an out-of-network provider to make sure you are aware of any additional costs you may be responsible for. By understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, as well as the cost sharing associated with each, you can make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses. While it is possible to receive care from an out-ofnetwork provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. When choosing a provider, it is important to consider the cost sharing associated with each provider and to ask about any additional fees before receiving care. \\n\\n\\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nWhen it comes to health insurance, many people are unaware of the different factors that impact the costs they pay. One of the most significant components that affects your costs is the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure you’re getting the best value for your health care services, it’s important to understand how providers can affect your costs. In-Network Providers Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a “co-pay” or “co-insurance”. It’s important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it’s best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be. Out-of-Network Providers Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider. Exceptions Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered. Additionally, it’s important to note that there may be different rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to mental health and substance abuse. Tips If you’re considering a provider that is not in-network, it’s important to understand the costs associated with that provider before you book an appointment. Contacting the provider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for Northwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you’ll be paying for services. Additionally, it’s important to check with Northwind Health to make sure the provider is covered by the Northwind Standard plan and what types of services are covered. When selecting a provider, it’s also important to consider the quality of care they provide. You should look for providers that offer high-quality care that meets your specific needs. Additionally, Northwind Health offers a variety of resources to help you find the right provider, such as a provider search tool and a provider directory. Choosing the right provider is important when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. By understanding how providers can affect your costs, you can make sure you’re getting the best value for your health care services. By using Northwind Health’s resources and researching providers in advance, you can make sure you’re getting the care you need at the best cost.', metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpaq3e_cb1/manyonepagefiles/Benefits For Out-Of-Network Or Non-Contracted Providers .docx'}),\n",
              "  Document(page_content='COVERED SERVICES \\n\\nAcupuncture \\n\\nCOVERED SERVICES:\\n\\nAcupuncture At Contoso, we are proud to offer employees Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that includes coverage for acupuncture. Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been used for centuries. It is based on the belief that energy, or qi, flows through the body and can be manipulated with needles to promote healing. Acupuncture is often used to treat chronic pain, headaches, digestive issues, stress, anxiety, and other conditions. It is generally considered to be safe and effective when administered by a trained and certified practitioner. Under Northwind Standard, acupuncture is covered as a preventive service. This means that acupuncture treatment is covered at no cost to the employee, before any diagnosis is made or symptoms are present. This coverage is designed to help encourage people to get preventive care before they experience any health problems. However, coverage for acupuncture is limited under Northwind Standard. The plan only covers acupuncture treatments that are administered by a licensed acupuncturist. Selfadministered treatments, such as acupressure or self-treatment with needles, are not covered. Additionally, the plan only covers acupuncture treatments that are deemed medically necessary. This means that treatments that are solely for relaxation or cosmetic purposes are not covered. If you are considering acupuncture as a treatment option, here are some tips to keep in mind: • Make sure the acupuncturist you choose is licensed and certified. • Ask about the acupuncturist’s experience and training. • Check to see if the acupuncturist is in-network with Northwind Standard. • Discuss the risks and expected benefits of acupuncture with your acupuncturist. • Ask your acupuncturist to explain the acupuncture treatment plan. • Discuss any questions or concerns you have about acupuncture with your doctor. At Contoso, we are committed to providing employees with access to quality and affordable healthcare. We are proud to offer Northwind Standard, an insurance plan that includes coverage for acupuncture, to help our employees stay healthy and well. Allergy Testing and Treatment COVERED SERVICES: Allergy Testing and Treatment The Northwind Standard plan covers the cost of allergy testing and treatment. Allergy testing is done to determine what substances a person is allergic to, and treatment can include medications, injections, and other therapies. Allergy testing and treatment are covered under this plan. What Is Covered Under the Northwind Standard plan, the following allergy testing and treatment services are covered: • Allergy skin testing • Allergy blood testing • Immunotherapy (allergy shots) • Prescription medications for allergies, such as antihistamines, decongestants, and corticosteroids • Non-prescription medications for allergies, such as antihistamines and decongestants • Allergy medications for asthma, such as albuterol • Allergy medications for skin conditions, such as topical corticosteroids • Nasal sprays for allergies Exceptions The Northwind Standard plan does not cover the cost of allergy testing or treatment for cosmetic purposes. Tips • Make sure to tell your doctor about any medications you are currently taking, as some medications can interfere with allergy testing or treatment. • If you are prescribed medications for allergies, be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. • Ask your doctor about other treatments that may be available, such as immunotherapy (allergy shots). • If you are prescribed medications for allergies, be sure to check with your pharmacist to see if there are any generic or over-the-counter options that may be more affordable. • Keep track of your allergies, including the type of allergy, the severity of the allergy, the medications you are taking, and the results of any allergy tests you have had. This information can be helpful for your doctor when making decisions about your care.\\n\\n', metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmp4_m43ife/manyonepagefiles/COVERED SERVICES.docx'}),\n",
              "  Document(page_content=\"Coinsurance \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: \\n\\nCoinsurance \\n\\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%. Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It’s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan’s copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. When you receive services, it’s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It’s also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-ofnetwork services. It’s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost. If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment. Finally, it’s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-ofpocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services. In summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It’s important to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-of-network services. Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your out-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed. Out-Of-Pocket Maximum IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-of-Pocket Maximum Employees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out-of-pocket maximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. This limit applies to certain covered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. The out-of-pocket maximum for the Northwind Standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain services may not be subject to the out-of-pocket maximum. These services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and treatment of an illness or injury. For example, non-covered services like cosmetic surgery, non-prescription drugs, or services that were provided outside of the Northwind Health network will not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. It's important for employees to remember that the out-of-pocket maximum will reset at the start of the calendar year. This means that any out-of-pocket expenses paid during the previous year will not carry over to the new year. To keep track of their out-of-pocket expenses, employees should review their insurance statements regularly. They should also review their Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for. This can help them to stay on top of their out-of-pocket expenses and avoid exceeding the maximum. Employees should also be aware that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost of premiums. The cost of premiums is not counted toward the out-of-pocket maximum and is in addition to any out-of-pocket expenses that employees incur. Finally, if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan, they should be aware that out-of-pocket costs can vary from plan to plan. Employees should compare the out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them. In summary, the Northwind Standard plan offers employees an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain services are not subject to this maximum and that their out-of-pocket expenses will reset at the start of the calendar year. They should also remember that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost of premiums. Finally, they should compare the out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them. Allowed Amount IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: ALLOWED AMOUNT In the Northwind Standard plan, an Allowed Amount is the maximum amount that the plan will pay for a covered service. It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any amount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a percentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed amount. In general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed Amount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount. It is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a service. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if it is more than the Allowed Amount. Exceptions: In some cases, a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be higher than the provider's charge. This may occur when the service is considered to be a non-covered service or when the service is not a usual or customary service. In these cases, the insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service. In addition, some services may have a separate deductible or coinsurance amount that must be met before the Allowed Amount is applied. These services may include hospitalization, emergency services, and certain types of outpatient services. Tips: When selecting a provider, ask the provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan and what their Allowed Amounts are. This will ensure that you are selecting a provider that will accept the plan and that you are aware of what your out-of-pocket costs may be. Make sure to keep all of your receipts and bills when you receive a service so that you can review them against your Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This will ensure that you are aware of any balance that may be owed after the Allowed Amount has been applied. Finally, remember that the Allowed Amount is not a guarantee of payment and that you may be responsible for paying any remaining balance. Therefore, it is important to review your EOB and contact the provider if there are any discrepancies or if you have any questions about the Allowed Amount.

              "  Document(page_content=\"HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nIn-Network Providers \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nWhen selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the network of in-network providers that are available with the plan. Northwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low. When you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an in-network provider. It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive them from an out-of-network provider. When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to make sure your provider is in-network. Second, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers may be in-network but not be taking new patients. Third, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be difficult for you to get to your appointments. Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to find a provider that has evening or weekend hours. Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan\\n\\nIt is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill you after the health plan pays them. When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services. Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service. Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate.

This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers. What is balance billing?

It is important to check if a provider is innetwork before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs.

A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay at the time of service, and it is generally a lower amount than what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost of the service. Copays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive. Generally speaking, copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits. For example, copays for office visits with a primary care physician may be $20, while copays for a hospital visit may be up to $150. It is important to note that the copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to state. In addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, such as prescriptions and diagnostic testing. For example, copays for generic prescription drugs may be $10, while copays for brand-name drugs may be $35. Copays for diagnostic testing, such as lab tests and X-rays, may range from $20 to $100 depending on the type of test. It is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover certain services, such as emergency services and mental health and substance abuse services. For these services, you may be responsible for the full cost of the service, so it is important to understand your plan and read the fine print before receiving any services. In addition to copays, you may also be charged coinsurance for certain services. Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that you are responsible for paying.

For example, preventive care services may be covered at no cost to you. This includes routine physical exams, immunizations, and screenings for certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Overall, copays are a great way to save money on health care services. Understanding your plan and reading the fine print can help you to save money on health care services.

A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. However, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally, prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per individual and $500 per family. It is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services. Tips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible Meeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it. First, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible without paying out of pocket. Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are not paying more than you have to for services. Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs. Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket. By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan\", metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpf2yzn0mo/manyonepagefiles/Important Plan Information.docx'}),\n",

When you receive health care from an in-network provider, your insurance plan will generally cover a greater portion of your expenses. However, when you receive health care from an out-of-network provider, you may be required to pay a greater portion of the costs. Under Northwind Standard, you may receive care from out-of-network providers, but you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is important to understand the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers and how they affect your costs. In-Network: In-network providers are those who have contracted with Northwind Health to provide services at a discounted rate. In-network providers have agreed to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you pay the portion of the cost that is not covered by the insurance plan. In-network providers may also offer additional services or discounts that are not available to out-of-network providers. Out-of-Network: Out-of-network providers are those who have not contracted with Northwind Health. As a result, they are not required to accept the amount of payment offered by Northwind Health, meaning that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the cost. Additionally, out-of-network providers may not offer additional services or discounts that are available to in-network providers. When choosing a provider, it is important to make sure that the provider is in-network. While it is possible to receive care from out-of-network providers, it is important to understand that you will be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. To make sure that you are getting the best value for your health care expenses, it is recommended that you choose an in-network provider whenever possible. There are some exceptions when it comes to receiving care from out-of-network providers. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, you may receive care from an outof-network provider. In these cases, the cost of care may be more expensive and you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. In addition to understanding the differences between in-network and out-of-network providers, it is important to understand the cost sharing associated with each. Northwind Standard does not cover the full cost of care for out-of-network providers, so you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. When choosing a provider, it is important to take into account the cost sharing associated with each provider. If you are unable to find an in-network provider in your area or if you require a specific type of care that is not available from an in-network provider, it is important to understand that you may be responsible for a greater portion of the costs. Finally, it is important to be aware of any additional fees that may be associated with receiving care from an out-of-network provider. Some providers may charge additional fees for services that are not covered by Northwind Standard. It is important to ask about any additional fees before receiving care from an out-of-network provider to make sure you are aware of any additional costs you may be responsible for.

One of the most significant components that affects your costs is the provider you choose. Northwind Standard provides coverage for a variety of in-network providers, and the costs associated with each provider can vary significantly. To ensure you’re getting the best value for your health care services, it’s important to understand how providers can affect your costs. In-Network Providers Choosing in-network providers is the most cost-effective option when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan. In-network providers have agreed to accept a discounted rate on services, which means they are often less expensive than out-of-network providers. When selecting an in-network provider, you will likely only have to pay a portion of the cost for services, often referred to as a “co-pay” or “co-insurance”. It’s important to note that different types of services may require different co-pays or co-insurance, so it’s best to contact your provider to understand what the cost will be. Out-of-Network Providers Northwind Standard offers coverage for some out-of-network providers, but the costs associated with these providers can be significantly more expensive than in-network providers. If you choose an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for the entire cost of services, or a far greater portion of the cost than you would with an in-network provider. In some cases, Northwind Standard may offer coverage for out-of-network providers, but you may still have to pay more than you would for an in-network provider. Exceptions Some providers may offer services that are outside of the Northwind Standard plan coverage. Depending on the services provided, you may have to pay out-of-pocket for services that are not covered. Additionally, it’s important to note that there may be different rules and coverage levels associated with certain types of services, such as those related to mental health and substance abuse. Tips If you’re considering a provider that is not in-network, it’s important to understand the costs associated with that provider before you book an appointment. Contacting the provider directly to ask about their rates, as well as any special arrangements they offer for Northwind Standard members, can help you get a better idea of what you’ll be paying for services. Additionally, it’s important to check with Northwind Health to make sure the provider is covered by the Northwind Standard plan and what types of services are covered. When selecting a provider, it’s also important to consider the quality of care they provide. You should look for providers that offer high-quality care that meets your specific needs. Additionally, Northwind Health offers a variety of resources to help you find the right provider, such as a provider search tool and a provider directory. Choosing the right provider is important when it comes to your Northwind Standard plan.

Acupuncture is an ancient form of healing that has been used for centuries. It is based on the belief that energy, or qi, flows through the body and can be manipulated with needles to promote healing. Acupuncture is often used to treat chronic pain, headaches, digestive issues, stress, anxiety, and other conditions. It is generally considered to be safe and effective when administered by a trained and certified practitioner. Under Northwind Standard, acupuncture is covered as a preventive service. This means that acupuncture treatment is covered at no cost to the employee, before any diagnosis is made or symptoms are present. This coverage is designed to help encourage people to get preventive care before they experience any health problems. However, coverage for acupuncture is limited under Northwind Standard. The plan only covers acupuncture treatments that are administered by a licensed acupuncturist. Selfadministered treatments, such as acupressure or self-treatment with needles, are not covered. Additionally, the plan only covers acupuncture treatments that are deemed medically necessary. This means that treatments that are solely for relaxation or cosmetic purposes are not covered. If you are considering acupuncture as a treatment option, here are some tips to keep in mind: • Make sure the acupuncturist you choose is licensed and certified. • Ask about the acupuncturist’s experience and training. • Check to see if the acupuncturist is in-network with Northwind Standard. • Discuss the risks and expected benefits of acupuncture with your acupuncturist. • Ask your acupuncturist to explain the acupuncture treatment plan. • Discuss any questions or concerns you have about acupuncture with your doctor.

Allergy testing is done to determine what substances a person is allergic to, and treatment can include medications, injections, and other therapies. Allergy testing and treatment are covered under this plan. What Is Covered Under the Northwind Standard plan, the following allergy testing and treatment services are covered: • Allergy skin testing • Allergy blood testing • Immunotherapy (allergy shots) • Prescription medications for allergies, such as antihistamines, decongestants, and corticosteroids • Non-prescription medications for allergies, such as antihistamines and decongestants • Allergy medications for asthma, such as albuterol • Allergy medications for skin conditions, such as topical corticosteroids • Nasal sprays for allergies Exceptions The Northwind Standard plan does not cover the cost of allergy testing or treatment for cosmetic purposes. Tips • Make sure to tell your doctor about any medications you are currently taking, as some medications can interfere with allergy testing or treatment. • If you are prescribed medications for allergies, be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions carefully. • Ask your doctor about other treatments that may be available, such as immunotherapy (allergy shots). • If you are prescribed medications for allergies, be sure to check with your pharmacist to see if there are any generic or over-the-counter options that may be more affordable. • Keep track of your allergies, including the type of allergy, the severity of the allergy, the medications you are taking, and the results of any allergy tests you have had.

              "  \"Coinsurance \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: \\n\\nCoinsurance \\n\\nCoinsurance is a type of cost sharing that you are responsible for after meeting your deductible. Coinsurance is often a percentage of the cost of the service you receive. For example, if the coinsurance is 10%, you will be responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the service you received, while the insurance company pays the other 90%. Under Northwind Standard, coinsurance is set at 20% for in-network services, with some exceptions. For in-network hospital stays, coinsurance is set at 25%. Additionally, coinsurance for out-of-network services is set at 40%. It’s important to note that coinsurance does not apply to the services that are covered by the plan’s copayment amounts. Copayment is a fixed amount that you are responsible for paying for certain services and is typically much less than coinsurance. Additionally, Northwind Standard does not require coinsurance for preventive care services. When you receive services, it’s important to ask about the cost of the service and make sure you are aware of any coinsurance costs. It’s also important to be aware of the coinsurance rate for out-of-network services and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-ofnetwork services. It’s also important to be aware that coinsurance costs are calculated based on the allowed amount for the service. This means if you receive a service that is more expensive than what is allowed by the plan, your coinsurance costs will be based on the allowed amount, not the actual cost. If you are unable to pay the coinsurance costs for a service up front, Northwind Standard will allow you to make payments over time. This is a great option for those who need services but may not be able to pay the entire coinsurance amount in one payment. Finally, it’s important to know that coinsurance costs are applied to your out-of-pocket maximum. This means that you can use coinsurance costs to help you reach your out-ofpocket maximum faster, thus reducing the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket for services. In summary, coinsurance is a cost sharing requirement under Northwind Standard that is typically 20% for in-network services and 40% for out-of-network services. It’s important to be aware of the costs associated with coinsurance and to consider if it’s worth the cost to pay more for out-of-network services. Additionally, coinsurance costs count towards your out-of-pocket maximum and you can make payments over time if needed. Out-Of-Pocket Maximum IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Out-of-Pocket Maximum Employees enrolled in the Northwind Standard plan can benefit from an out-of-pocket maximum that helps to protect them from large medical bills. This limit applies to certain covered services and includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. The out-of-pocket maximum for the Northwind Standard plan is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain services may not be subject to the out-of-pocket maximum. These services include any charges that are not related to the diagnosis and treatment of an illness or injury. For example, non-covered services like cosmetic surgery, non-prescription drugs, or services that were provided outside of the Northwind Health network will not count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. It's important for employees to remember that the out-of-pocket maximum will reset at the start of the calendar year. This means that any out-of-pocket expenses paid during the previous year will not carry over to the new year. To keep track of their out-of-pocket expenses, employees should review their insurance statements regularly. They should also review their Explanation of Benefits (EOB) documents to make sure that all of their expenses have been properly accounted for. This can help them to stay on top of their out-of-pocket expenses and avoid exceeding the maximum. Employees should also be aware that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost of premiums. The cost of premiums is not counted toward the out-of-pocket maximum and is in addition to any out-of-pocket expenses that employees incur. Finally, if employees are thinking of switching to a different health plan, they should be aware that out-of-pocket costs can vary from plan to plan. Employees should compare the out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them. In summary, the Northwind Standard plan offers employees an out-of-pocket maximum of $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a family. Employees should be aware that certain services are not subject to this maximum and that their out-of-pocket expenses will reset at the start of the calendar year. They should also remember that the out-of-pocket maximum does not include the cost of premiums. Finally, they should compare the out-of-pocket maximums and deductibles of different plans before deciding which one is best for them. Allowed Amount IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: ALLOWED AMOUNT In the Northwind Standard plan, an Allowed Amount is the maximum amount that the plan will pay for a covered service. It includes both the amount that the plan pays and any amount that the insured is responsible for paying. This total Allowed Amount is usually a percentage of the provider's charge. In some cases, the Allowed Amount may be a fixed amount. In general, the Allowed Amount is the lesser of the provider's charge, the plan's Allowed Amount, and the copayment amount. This means that the insured may be responsible for paying the difference between the provider's charge and the Allowed Amount. It is important to remember that the Allowed Amount may not cover the entire cost of a service. Therefore, the insured may be responsible for paying any remaining balance, even if it is more than the Allowed Amount. Exceptions: In some cases, a service may not have an Allowed Amount or the Allowed Amount may be higher than the provider's charge. This may occur when the service is considered to be a non-covered service or when the service is not a usual or customary service. In these cases, the insured will be responsible for paying the entire cost of the service. In addition, some services may have a separate deductible or coinsurance amount that must be met before the Allowed Amount is applied. These services may include hospitalization, emergency services, and certain types of outpatient services. Tips: When selecting a provider, ask the provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan and what their Allowed Amounts are. This will ensure that you are selecting a provider that will accept the plan and that you are aware of what your out-of-pocket costs may be. Make sure to keep all of your receipts and bills when you receive a service so that you can review them against your Explanation of Benefits (EOB). This will ensure that you are aware of any balance that may be owed after the Allowed Amount has been applied. Finally, remember that the Allowed Amount is not a guarantee of payment and that you may be responsible for paying any remaining balance. Therefore, it is important to review your EOB and contact the provider if there are any discrepancies or if you have any questions about the Allowed Amount.

              "  \"HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nIn-Network Providers \\n\\nHOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS \\n\\nWhen selecting a health insurance plan, one of the most important factors to consider is the network of in-network providers that are available with the plan. Northwind Standard offers a wide variety of in-network providers, ranging from primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. This allows you to choose a provider that is convenient for you and your family, while also helping you to keep your costs low. When you choose a provider that is in-network with your plan, you will typically pay lower copays and deductibles than you would with an out-of-network provider. In addition, many services, such as preventive care, may be covered at no cost when you receive care from an in-network provider. It is important to note, however, that Northwind Standard does not offer coverage for emergency services, mental health and substance abuse coverage, or out-of-network services. This means that you may have to pay out of pocket for these services if you receive them from an out-of-network provider. When choosing an in-network provider, there are a few tips to keep in mind. First, make sure that the provider you choose is in-network with your plan. You can confirm this by calling the provider's office and asking them if they are in-network with Northwind Standard. You can also use the provider search tool on the Northwind Health website to make sure your provider is in-network. Second, make sure that the provider you choose is accepting new patients. Some providers may be in-network but not be taking new patients. Third, consider the location of the provider. If the provider is too far away, it may be difficult for you to get to your appointments. Finally, consider the provider's office hours. If you work during the day, you may need to find a provider that has evening or weekend hours. Choosing an in-network provider can help you save money on your health care costs. By following the tips above and researching your options, you can find a provider that is convenient, affordable, and in-network with your Northwind Standard plan\\n\\nIt is also important to ask your provider about their policy on balance billing. Be sure to find out if the provider requires you to pay the balance billing amount up front, or if they will bill you after the health plan pays them. When selecting a provider, also remember to consider the cost of services. Participating providers are often more cost effective than non-participating providers. Additionally, some providers offer discounts to patients who pay out of pocket for services. Finally, if you need to use a non-participating provider for certain services, be sure to check with your health plan first. There may be an exception that will cover the cost of the service. Additionally, if you need to use a non-participating provider and you are concerned about the cost, you can always negotiate with your provider to find a more affordable rate. Balance Billing Protection HOW PROVIDERS AFFECT YOUR COSTS - Balance Billing Protection At Contoso, we understand that medical costs can be intimidating and confusing, which is why we’ve partnered with Northwind Health to offer our employees the Northwind Standard plan. This plan provides a balance billing protection, meaning that you are protected from unexpected costs when visiting in-network providers. What is balance billing? Balance billing is when a provider bills you for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. This difference can be hundreds of dollars and is often unexpected. With the Northwind Standard plan, you are protected from balance billing when visiting in-network providers. What is an in-network provider? In-network providers are healthcare providers, such as doctors, hospitals, and labs, that have agreed to accept the Northwind Standard plan’s payment terms. Visiting an in-network provider means that you are protected from balance billing. You can find a list of in-network providers on the Northwind Health website. What if I visit an out-of-network provider? Visiting an out-of-network provider means that you are not protected from balance billing. Out-of-network providers may charge more for the same services than in-network providers, and you may be responsible for the difference between what they charge and what your insurance company is willing to pay. It is important to check if a provider is innetwork before visiting them to avoid any unexpected costs. Tips to avoid balance billing: • Always check if a provider is in-network before scheduling an appointment.\\n\\n\\n\\nAsk your provider if they accept the Northwind Standard plan before you receive any services. • Double-check that the providers you visit are in-network. • Ask for an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time. • If you receive a bill for more than expected, contact your provider and the insurance company to negotiate a lower cost.

              "  \"IMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION \\n\\nCopayments (Copays) \\n\\nIMPORTANT PLAN INFORMATION: Copayments (Copays) At Northwind Health, our Northwind Standard plan includes copayments (copays) for certain services. A copayment is a fixed amount that you pay at the time of service, and it is generally a lower amount than what you would have to pay if you were to pay the full cost of the service. Copays for Northwind Standard vary depending on the type of service you receive. Generally speaking, copays for office visits are typically less than copays for hospital visits. For example, copays for office visits with a primary care physician may be $20, while copays for a hospital visit may be up to $150. It is important to note that the copays may vary from provider to provider and from state to state. In addition to office visits, copays may also apply to other services, such as prescriptions and diagnostic testing. For example, copays for generic prescription drugs may be $10, while copays for brand-name drugs may be $35. Copays for diagnostic testing, such as lab tests and X-rays, may range from $20 to $100 depending on the type of test. It is important to note that Northwind Standard does not cover certain services, such as emergency services and mental health and substance abuse services. For these services, you may be responsible for the full cost of the service, so it is important to understand your plan and read the fine print before receiving any services. In addition to copays, you may also be charged coinsurance for certain services. Coinsurance is a percentage of the cost of the service that you are responsible for paying. Generally speaking, coinsurance rates are lower than copays, so it is important to understand the difference between the two. Finally, there are some exceptions to the copayment rules. For example, preventive care services may be covered at no cost to you. This includes routine physical exams, immunizations, and screenings for certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Overall, copays are a great way to save money on health care services. Understanding your plan and reading the fine print can help you to save money on health care services.

A calendar year deductible is the amount you must pay for health care services before your insurance plan starts to pay. The deductible applies to most services received from in-network providers, including primary care physicians, specialists, hospitals, and pharmacies. However, there are some exceptions. For example, preventive care services, such as immunizations and annual physicals, are covered at 100% with no deductible. Additionally, prescription drugs are subject to a separate prescription drug deductible of $250 per individual and $500 per family. It is important to note that this deductible does not roll over into the next year. This means that you must meet the deductible amount in the current year before your insurance begins to pay. Additionally, the deductible may not apply to all services. For example, you may not be subject to the deductible when you receive in-network emergency services. Tips for Meeting the Calendar Year Deductible Meeting your calendar year deductible may seem like a daunting task, but there are a few steps you can take to help ensure that you reach it. First, take advantage of any preventive care services that are covered at 100%. These services are important for your health, and you can use them to help meet your deductible without paying out of pocket. Second, use caution when selecting providers. The Northwind Standard plan has a large network of in-network providers, and using these providers will help ensure that you are not paying more than you have to for services. Third, consider using a health savings account (HSA). An HSA is a tax-advantaged savings account that can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses. Contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible and the funds can be used to help pay for deductibles and other medical costs. Finally, take advantage of any discount programs that may be available. Many providers offer discounts for cash payments on services, and these can help reduce the amount of money you need to pay out of pocket. By following these tips, you can make sure that you reach your deductible and take advantage of the full benefits of the Northwind Standard plan\",\n",
