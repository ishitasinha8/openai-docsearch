            " Criminal violence against Black Americans has been a major issue in the United States in the last two decades. The rate of violence in the Black American communities was exceedingly high, with the number of violence cases in the United States among the Black Americans exceeding the number of those in both Germany and France by twenty-eight times. In 1990, most of homicidal cases were discovered to target Black American males by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Additionally, the highest number of these cases involved men between the ages of fifteen and twenty-four years. The number of crime victims within this age was around one hundred and thirty two out of one hundred thousand youths. Among these crimes, most of them ended up in deaths and fatal or permanent injuries. The rate of acquisition of weapons among the black American community is the largest factor that causes the huge crime rate. In the early part of the 1980’s, most of the crimes charged for were related to the use of firearms.\n",
